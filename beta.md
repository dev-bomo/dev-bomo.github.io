    <p>The Arbour has been properly tested before reaching the beta phase but if there's any failure
        we'll be happy to get it fixed or replaced and we'll work out a deal in case you want to
        swap it out for a production version once those are out.</p>
    <p>The beta testing program starts 9th of May 2019, the first devices will ship 1st of August 2019. This is so     we can iron out the kinks in the prototype hardware, make the app prettier, do a lot of testing and figure     out all the legal parts.</p>
    <p>Devices go out on a first registered basis and the number will be capped at 50</p>
    <p>We're a company that's just starting out and building hardware is expensive. That's why we
        will ask for a small upfront payment when you sign up to be part of the Arbour beta testing
        program. You can choose the contribution amount and you'll pay the rest when your product is
        ready.</p>
